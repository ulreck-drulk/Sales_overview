# Power BI Sales Dashboard

## In this project:
 I restored the [AdventureWorksDW2019.bak](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms) database.
 The main objective is to show a comparisson between the budget provided (from 2022 to  half 2023) against the sales we have for those years.
 First I prepare the DataBase separating the tables in Fact and Dimensional to have a general overview
 All data was then extracted to a Data Warehouse for further processing
 The warehouse was used with Power BI Desktop and then published publicly.
 All the tools used to complete this project are shown below.
 Overall we can determine the company has a prety solid return from sales comapred to their budget being the "Serious Back" their best product.
